This Haskell code attempts to use a `Maybe` value directly in a function that expects an `Int`.  The `Maybe` type represents a value that might be `Nothing` (absent) or `Just x` (present).  If `x` is `Nothing`, the program will crash with a runtime error because it attempts to unwrap a `Nothing` value. 
```haskell
processNumber :: Maybe Int -> Int
processNumber num = num * 2

main :: IO ()
main = do
  let result = processNumber (Just 5)
  print result
  let result2 = processNumber Nothing
  print result2
```
